# Mathematica-projects
Here you can find all kinds of problems programmed and solved with Mathematica 

In this file, I put various types of programs written in Mathematica, which are used to solve the physics and mathematics problems of interest to me. I also provide a description of the solved problem if someone would like to try to write a program to solve the problem independently.

Pendulum with a movable attachment point. 
This project is related to an interesting problem in classical mechanics. 
A mathematical pendulum with a mass of m2 is suspended on a horizontal bar. An attachment point of mass m1 can move along the rod without friction. What is the solution to the equations of motion for this system? This problem can be solved analytically; however, the solution is nontrivial, and it may be hard to see the basic intuition. 

The file presents a graphical solution to this problem with the possibility of modifying the initial conditions. This allows for creating an intuition on how such a system would behave.
